He has evidenced by his behaviour a pro criminal attitude both to staff and wider society in general\r\n\r\n\r\n        He has previously presented with pro-criminal attitudes and has minimised his own behaviour and blamed others fro his actions- ie: places blame on his partner Ms Small for his own behaviour. During past and current supervision periods, Mr Davies has failed to comply with appointments and conditions, resulting in convictions for breach and recalls on licence. \r\n        \r\n        There is no evidence of discriminatory attitudes. \r\n        \r\n        It is clear that Mr Davies places his own perceived needs and wishes, above those of his victims, partner, community and society. Given his history of offending he has evidenced poor motivation to change and holds attitudes that are supportive of offending behaviour.\r\n        \r\n        I have met Mr Davies a number of times at HMP Berwyn  and he always been polite with me, and there have not been any overt attitudes of concern. I am aware his behaviour can be difficult on the wing. \r\n        \r\n        Attitudes will be linked to ROR and ROSH",

On Thursday 27th September 2022 between 12:20 and 12:40 the defendant has become embroiled in a street altercation with another male that has resulted in a fight. Patrolling Officers are advised by a member of public of the fight and attend and intervene. The defendant has been argumentative and refused to calm down, eventually climbing onto a wall and punching the other male to the side of the head. Although the aggreived party has not wished to pursue a complaint, the threats and act of violence has occurred in front of attending Officers wearing BWV.\r\n    \r\n    Roger SMITH has stated that he was in uniform on foot patrol when he has been informed of a fight on Long Row.

He states he \\\"saw red\\\" at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment. This raises some concern regarding his thinking skills and problem solving and is likely to have been exacerbated by him being under the influence of alcohol and substances. "

Whilst this is Mr Davies' recent disclosure, I will not yet change the scoring levels of above drug use until such a time when abstinence can be evidenced via drug testing.\r\n\r\nMr Davies dismissed any issues with drug misuse in custody, stating he is drug free.

He reports no constructive activities.\r\n        \r\n        He has been recalled on a number of occasions whilst serving past and current sentences,  which is an indication that he is not  motivated to make changes to his lifestyle and demonstrating a lack of regard for his licence and conditions. \r\n        \r\n        As previous section, there have been previous concerns regarding Child sexual exploitation therefore associates will need to be closely monitored.\r\n        \r\n        I have been made aware of a video circulating on social media which shows Mr Davies in a violent altercation with an associate- xxx xxx. The police were investigating this incident with a view to an Affray prosecution, however no arrests have been made to date. Mr Davies appears to be trying to 'slash' Mr xxx with broken glass. he describes him as a friend and they had an argument over a misunderstanding (linked to Sexual Jealousy as he believed that friend was trying to contact his partner Ms xxx). There was a further incident disclosed a week later, whereby Mr Davies claims he attempted to hit Mt xxx once again, this time with a piece of wood. Both incident occurred when Mr Davies was intoxicated.\r\n        \r\n        Mr Davies has raised concerns about his safety at HMP Cardiff, avoiding movements between wings to attend work for fear of others and stipulating that he need to go to HMP Berwyn for his own safety (not HMP Parc).",

He has evidenced by his behaviour a pro criminal attitude both to staff and wider society in general\r\n\r\n\r\n        He has previously presented with pro-criminal attitudes and has minimised his own behaviour and blamed others fro his actions- ie: places blame on his partner Ms Small for his own behaviour. During past and current supervision periods, Mr Davies has failed to comply with appointments and conditions, resulting in convictions for breach and recalls on licence. \r\n        \r\n        There is no evidence of discriminatory attitudes. \r\n        \r\n        It is clear that Mr Davies places his own perceived needs and wishes, above those of his victims, partner, community and society. Given his history of offending he has evidenced poor motivation to change and holds attitudes that are supportive of offending behaviour.\r\n        \r\n        I have met Mr Davies a number of times at HMP Berwyn  and he always been polite with me, and there have not been any overt attitudes of concern. I am aware his behaviour can be difficult on the wing. \r\n        \r\n        Attitudes will be linked to ROR and ROSH",

He states the group of men had been making some comments that Mr Davies interpreted as being supportive of domestic abuse. He states he \\\"saw red\\\" at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment. This raises some concern regarding his thinking skills and problem solving and is likely to have been exacerbated by him being under the influence of alcohol and substances. ",

The violence would seem to becoming more frequent with the violence being used also increasing.

On Thursday 27th September 2022 between 12:20 and 12:40 the defendant has become embroiled in a street altercation with another male that has resulted in a fight.

However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment.
