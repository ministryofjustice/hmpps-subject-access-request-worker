He states the group of men had been making some comments that Mr Davies interpreted as being supportive of domestic abuse. He states he \\\"saw red\\\" at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment. This raises some concern regarding his thinking skills and problem solving and is likely to have been exacerbated by him being under the influence of alcohol and substances. ",

The violence would seem to becoming more frequent with the violence being used also increasing.

His attitudes that condone violence raise significant concerns as he has continued to use this as a technique and response to conflict.

The risk Mr Davies poses is high when under the influence of alcohol. It is my assessment that analysis of offence issues are linked to the risk of serious harm. ",

On Thursday 27th September 2022 between 12:20 and 12:40 the defendant has become embroiled in a street altercation with another male that has resulted in a fight. Patrolling Officers are advised by a member of public of the fight and attend and intervene.

He states he \\\"saw red\\\" at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment.

On Thursday 27th September 2022 between 12:20 and 12:40 the defendant has become embroiled in a street altercation with another male that has resulted in a fight. Patrolling Officers are advised by a member of public of the fight and attend and intervene.

He states he \\\"saw red\\\" at these comments and this is the reason the assault occured. However, Mr Davies does dispute himself whether his recollection of events is correct and at the time of Police interview answered no comment. This raises some concern regarding his thinking skills and problem solving and is likely to have been exacerbated by him being under the influence of alcohol and substances. "
